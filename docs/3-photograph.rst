3. How to Photograph Archival Assets

3.1. Technical Specifications (Equipment, Process)
**************************************************

If you are able to photograph the archival recordings, you should try to do so at the beginning of your cataloguing process. Photograph each side of the artifact and its case, as well as any accompanying material containing textual information. Photographs should be in .jpeg or .png file format and at least 500 pixels in width if possible. There is a 2 MB file size limit.

3.2. How to name and format image files
***************************************

In taking photos of the archival audio artifacts, you will be generating new data (digital image files) and those files will also need to be named properly for easy use. Each filename of an image should have the following syntax:

  [Collection name]_[Fonds number]_[Box number]_ID_Side number.jpeg [*]_

NOTE: Not all collections will be coming from archives, so this syntax won't apply to all. 

Examples:

* Kiyooka_Msc321_Box8_128_Side1.jpeg
* Kiyooka_Msc321_Box10_insert.jpeg
* Gilbert_21_Side2.png
* Ultimatum_5-3_Side1.png

.. [*] Collection name may be derived from the name of the fonds. If the fonds is author fonds, then use the author’s last name (i.e. “Kiyooka”, “Gilbert”, etc.). If the fonds is an event series, use the name of the series (i.e. “Ultimatum”, “Véhicule”, etc.). Supply fonds and box number when available, and use any extant ID numbers if the collection has already been catalogued. The object is always the primary source of information for determining a unique ID number. 

Note that there should be no spaces in the filename and that only the first letter of each term is capitalized. List all file names using a comma.
