At times you may find that the information requested by this cataloguing process document is not available, or that the information you have does not easily fit into the schema and rules of the SpokenWeb guidelines. Sometimes you will discover questions that this document does not answer. Therefore, you should document any questions, decisions or variables that are not addressed within it, or that are contrary to it. These documented questions and issues and other relevant points of information pertaining to the cataloguing process should be provided to Jason Camlot (jason.camlot@concordia.ca). Your documented questions and feedback will be integrated into our analysis of the process throughout the cataloguing activities so that we can continue to improve upon our schema and clarify our description of the cataloguing process.
